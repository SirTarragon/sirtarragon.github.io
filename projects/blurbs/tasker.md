Tasker is a task management application written in C#. It was a incrementally built project, each assignment adding more features and capabilities as we learned C#. It was for the course CIS4930-0002 C# Programming at Florida State University during the Spring of 2022. It is mainly a GUI interface with MongoDB capabilities in the backend (though it is not currently connected to a database). It is capable of saving and loading on the local PC when the online service isn't available.
