ğŸ”­ Currently I'm trying to:

- ğŸŒ± learn and pass my CS courses and other courses
- ğŸŒ± learn how to use Unity/gamedev
- ğŸŒ± and maybe look into machine learning (though I haven't done much with learning that so far)
- come up with attainable project ideas (and not make myself drown in the process by overreaching)
