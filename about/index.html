    I've always been interested in computers as a kid, and unabashedly will state it's because of video games. Sadly I didn't 
    make my decision on what to pursue professionally until I got into college. Really wasn't that sure of myself as a kid, honestly 
    bumbled along with different interests like Creative Writing and History. For a short, while it was also Music, I used to play 
    the Euphonium in middle school and high school band and loved my time in the marching band.
    <br>
    <br>
    I started thinking more about programming after taking an HTML course at my high school (Thanks Mr. Karmanos!). I truly 
    came to the decision after taking Intro to C++ at TCC, my success in the class motivated me to push further into programming. 
    I always had the issue of keeping my motivation during self-learning as a kid, and I greatly appreciate that it changed.

    I'm trying to do my best juggling with my time and interests:
    <br>
    <ul align="left">
        <li>learning in and outside of school</li>
        <li>studying</li>
        <li>playing video games</li>
        <li>practicing programming</li>
        <li>finding time to relax and just game</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    Very simple interests.
    <br>
    <br>
    ðŸ”­ Currently I'm trying to:
    <br>
    <ul align="left">
        <li>ðŸŒ± learn and pass my CS courses and other courses</li>
        <li>ðŸŒ± learn how to use Unity/gamedev</li>
        <li>ðŸŒ± and maybe look into machine learning (though I haven't done much with learning that so far)</li>
        <li>come up with attainable project ideas (and not make myself drown in the process by overreaching)</li>
    </ul>
