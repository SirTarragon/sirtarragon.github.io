With my semester having come to a close, finals and projects, I'm finding myself with a lot more
available time to do things. Right now I'm taking to learning a bit of HTML and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com); I'm
mainly following along with this guide post by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to
set up some initial things for my Github page. It likely won't fully stick to this appearance, but that requires
time to learn and to figure out new things.

The code for the projects page was mostly compiled from [personal website repository offered by Github](https://github.com/github/personal-website).
I certainly plan on changing it to somewhat simulate the Github profile by allowing it to showcase pinned projects.

I went from there to Sindre Sorhus' [GitHub page](https://github.com/sindresorhus/sindresorhus.github.com) for more inspiration,
though admittedly I ended up using a lot of it for this website. I understand a lot more easily aspects of the HTML portion
of the site, but I'm evidently lost with aspects of CSS and other configurable options. This is a bit of a learning curve
for me, but I'm sure I'll be able to get used to it. SASS has me a bit shaky as well.

What I do know is that this won't be the final edition for my portfolio website, but I'm going to keep it around for now.
