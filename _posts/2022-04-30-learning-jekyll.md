With my semester having come to a close, finals and projects, I'm finding myself with a lot more
available time to do things. Right now I'm taking to learning a bit of HTML and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com); I'm
mainly following along with this guide post by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to 
set up some initial things for my Github page. It likely won't fully stick to this appearance, but that requires
time to learn and to figure out new things.
