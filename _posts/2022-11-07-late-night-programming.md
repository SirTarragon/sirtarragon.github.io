It's been a while since I've written up one of these. I've been busy with school and private tutoring, but I've been taking the time as of late to work on a small page for a class project named [PythonChess](https://github.com/SirTarragon/PythonChess). It's been completed a while ago now, but went and figured out how to compile the python code into an executable and pushed it as a release for it. Honestly, it's more of a break from another project that's been going on this semester.

Here's a small peak:

The game is simply a tower defense game, one with a randomly generating path. As of late, I've been working on trying to figure out path splitability--as in, allowing for things like crossroads to appear in the path and for more enemies to spawn. It's a steady progress converting the system that I previously coded in place to allow for this, sometimes it's a bit of a headache, but I'm getting there.

Until next time.
